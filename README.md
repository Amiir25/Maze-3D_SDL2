üéÆ 3D Maze Game  

## Introduction  
Welcome to **3D Maze Game**, a first-person maze exploration game built using **C, SDL2, and Raycasting**. Navigate through a labyrinth and find the exit!  

This project was developed as part of my Software Engineering Portfolio Project. It showcases fundamental raycasting techniques, player movement mechanics, and 2D-to-3D rendering using SDL2.

## Features
- 3D First-Person Exploration: Move through the maze with a realistic 3D perspective using raycasting.
- Textured Walls & Floor: The game supports custom textures, making the maze visually appealing.
- Customizable Maps: The game loads maps from a file, allowing users to design their own mazes.

## How It Works
- Raycasting
The game uses raycasting to simulate a 3D environment from a 2D grid. Each frame, rays are cast from the player's viewpoint, detecting walls and drawing scaled vertical slices to simulate depth.

## Core Algorithm Snippet
for (x = 0; x < SCREEN_WIDTH; x++)
{
    float rayAngle = (playerAngle - FOV / 2) + ((float)x / SCREEN_WIDTH) * FOV;
    float rayX = cos(rayAngle);
    float rayY = sin(rayAngle);
    
    while (!hitWall)
    {
        mapX = (int)(rayPosX / TILE_SIZE);
        mapY = (int)(rayPosY / TILE_SIZE);
        if (map[mapY][mapX] == 1) hitWall = true;
    }
    
    drawWallSlice(x, distance);
}
